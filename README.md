# Kenford's Speed Typing Test

## A basic web application for users to test their typing speed!
This was one of the first projects that I have built as I was learning standard web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this website was just to practice DOM manipulation and apply other newly learned concepts.
