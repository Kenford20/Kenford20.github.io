# Kenford's Speed Typing Test

## A basic web application for users to test their typing speed!
This was one of the first projects that I have built as I was learning standard web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The main purpose of this website was just to practice DOM manipulation and apply other newly learned concepts.

## Demo
Here is a live working demo: https://kenford20.github.io

## Features
* Typing speed displayed in words per minute and characters per minute
* Several different types of tests to be typed out, which are mostly fetched from some free public APIs via AJAX: 
  * Random Quotes
  * Random alphanumeric string
  * Random lorem text
  * Random long list of words that begin with a letter

## Technologies used
Vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
